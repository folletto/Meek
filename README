WHAT IS MEEK
============

It's a humble & lightweight PHP engine to build small websites.
Meek maps directly URL to files and templates with a neat fallback system.




HOW TO USE MEEK
===============

1. Download or git clone git@github.com:folletto/Meek.git
2. Edit .htaccess
3. Write your templates inside templates/ folder.
4. Write your content in pages/ folder.
5. (optional) Write any constant variable in cfg.json.




MEEK URL MAPPING
================

If we imagine Meek installed at http://example.org/app/, in its simplest form the
URL mapping does this:

URL: http://example.org/app/path/to/file
Loads: pages/path.to.file.php
With the template from: templates/tpl.path.to.file.php

Simple right?

It does also a couple other tricks:

1. PAGES AUTO-FALLBACK
If pages/path.to.file.php is missing, it will try to load, in order:
pages/path.to.php
pages/path.php
pages/404.php
In this way you can build a kind of controller that reads the next URL token from 
the pre-parsed array at: $this->virtual_uri and load the named item.

2. TEMPLATES AUTO-FALLBACK
If templates/tpl.path.to.file.php is missing, it will try to load (like pages), in order:
templates/tpl.path.to.php
templates/tpl.path.php
templates/tpl.php
In this way you can control very well what's going to appear on each page.
You can even create a templates/tpl.api.php template that returns JSON or XML and build
a simple API.
